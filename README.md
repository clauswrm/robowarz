__Creating the best behavior-based robot for graph traversal__

## About
To learn _Behavior-Based Robotics_ (BBR), a simple but powerful,
general strategy for robot control, we built a robot that will
follow a graph lined on a flat surface until it finds its goal.

The robot consists mainly of a Raspberry Pi 2 and a Zumo chassis.
The behavior is based on input form sensors such as camera,
reflectance, ultrasound and proximity sensors.

This was an assignment for the subject _TDT4113 CS Programming
Project_ at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
